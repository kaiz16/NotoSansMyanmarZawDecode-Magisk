# NotoSansMyanmarZawDecode - Magisk

## Requirements
1. Magisk V18+

## Info
Android 10 brings major system level changes including a new ZawDecode font for Myanmar users. What this means is we no longer need to install separate Zawgyi font since ZawDecode can render Zawgyi and Unicode simultaneously. This is the backported module that replaces your Unicode (or Zawgyi) with ZawDecode from Android 10.
